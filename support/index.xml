Version numbers throughout this topic use SemVer conventions; in the version &amp;ldquo;3.21.7,&amp;rdquo; we say that &amp;ldquo;3&amp;rdquo; is the major version, &amp;ldquo;21&amp;rdquo; is the minor version, and &amp;ldquo;7&amp;rdquo; is the micro or patch number.
Starting with the v20.x protoc release, we changed our versioning scheme to enable nimbler updates to language-specific parts of Protocol Buffers.</description></item><item><title>Migration Guide</title><link>https://protobuf.dev/support/migration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://protobuf.dev/support/migration/</guid><description>Compiler Changes in v22.0 JSON Field Name Conflicts Source of changes: PR #11349, PR #10750
We&amp;rsquo;ve made some subtle changes in how we handle field name conflicts with respect to JSON mappings. In proto3, we&amp;rsquo;ve partially loosened the restrictions and only give errors when field names produce case-sensitive JSON mappings (camel case of the original name). We now also check the json_name option, and give errors for case-sensitive conflicts. In proto2, we&amp;rsquo;ve tightened restrictions a bit and will give errors if two json_name specifications conflict.</description></item><item><title>Cross-Version Runtime Guarantee</title><link>https://protobuf.dev/support/cross-version-runtime-guarantee/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://protobuf.dev/support/cross-version-runtime-guarantee/</guid><description>Protobuf language bindings have two components. The generated code (typically produced from protoc) and the runtime libraries that must be included when using the generated code. When these come from different releases of protobuf, we are in a &amp;ldquo;cross version runtime&amp;rdquo; situation.
We intend to offer the following guarantees across all languages except C++. These are the default guarantees; however, owners of protobuf code generators and runtimes may explicitly override them with more specific guarantees for that language.</description></item></channel></rss>
